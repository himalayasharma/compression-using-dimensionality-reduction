The project aimed to analyze wearable physiological sensor data through the use of 6 feature extraction techniques and 3 feature selection methods. The reduced data was then evaluated for its classification performance using 4 machine learning algorithms: KNN, Decision Trees, SVC, and Random Forest. The results showed impressive compression rates of up to 99.25% with a minor accuracy loss of only 6.7%. The project aimed to demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques in achieving high data compression while preserving the accuracy of the analysis.
